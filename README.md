# NeuralGardenSim-Learn

https://moccajoghurt.github.io/plant_growth_simulation/

This repository contains the Plant Growth Simulation project, a personal educational venture into understanding neural networks and genetic algorithms. It's a hands-on approach to learning, where I explore how different environmental factors like sunlight, water, wind, and soil quality can affect plant characteristics in a simulated environment. The project doesn't have practical applications but serves as a valuable learning tool for me to deepen my knowledge in machine learning and algorithmic techniques.
